# https://neetcode.io/problems/daily-temperatures
# You are given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.
# Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day.
# If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.

# Example :
# Input: temperatures = [30,38,30,36,35,40,28]
# Output: [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []

        for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and temp > stack[-1][0]:
                stackT, stackInd = stack.pop()
                res[stackInd] = i - stackInd
            stack.append((temp, i))
        return res
